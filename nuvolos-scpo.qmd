## What is the Issue?

::: {.incremental}

1. Modern (Economic) Research requires powerful computational infrastructure.
2. Many Machine Learning applications require access to GPU compute.
3. Large memory applications: Models with a large state space.
4. Bootstrapping of statistical models.
5. The requirement for powerful compute is no longer the domain of a few obscure macro economists (üòà) who run their `fortran` via `MPI` on the HPC (High Performance Computing) cluster of their university. (Also: access to HPC clusters is still a topic for job market candidates each year.)
6. üëâ Powerful compute requirements are becoming **normal**.

:::

## The HPC Cluster?

* The traditional solution would have been to invest and maintain a dedicated HPC cluster.
* Costly. Not long-lived (need to upgrade frequently).
* Not overly user-friendly.
* HPC cluster might make sense for large Universities with dedicated staff (and CS research departments...)

# Low and Behold

SciencesPo does *not* have any high performance computing infrastructure for that reason.
:::
:::

::: {.fragment}
* The world has moved on: hyper scalers like [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com), [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us) etc provide _elastic compute_ services on demand, and at relatively low cost.

:::

## So: Why not AWS or Azure then?

::: {.incremental}

1. Cheapest available compute.
2. For a small org like an Econ Department (or a single researcher) the setup costs are prohibitive.
3. Not user friendly. [Demo here (probably outdated)](https://floswald.github.io/html/cluster.html).

## Nuvolos: [https://nuvolos.cloud](https://nuvolos.cloud)

::: {.incremental}

* Sits on top of Azure infrastructure: access to virtually unlimited computing power.
* Offers 24/7 access to computing instances. Their business model is to figure out competitive pricing for provisioning those machines...
* ... and to provide world-class support. 
* Much more user-friendly than hyper scalers.
* Built for small research teams and teaching which requires compute.

## Nuvolos

### Applications

::: {.incremental}
* You can run *any* application on nuvolos. Behaves like a standard Linux machine.
* (You can *not* run applications which run on windows only for the the same reason. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)
* For licensed products you need to bring your license; either as a file or as a network license.
* `STATA`, `matlab`, `gurobi`, `INTEL MKL`, `knitro`, `mathematica` etc
* _Of course_ all open source software is available.
* Support on the platform is **5 stars**. ü•á

### Who Could Use This?

::: {.incremental}

1. Small Research Teams: Your RA works on the same machine as you.
2. Individual Researcher: Running a 48h job on nuvolos is more (energy) efficient than running it on your office computer.
3. Teaching classes with significant compute setup costs or high demands (like machine learning etc)

### Demo

1. Tour of platform, file browser, applications, access, instances
2. Demonstration of scaling an application via GPU speedup (Python application)
3. Demonstration of scaling an application via multithreading [julia application](https://github.com/floswald/2021-03-17-parallelization-tutorial)
